Theme with Columnal
===================

This is an early attempt to design a theme for my blog.

I tried:

1. [Columnal][id]
1. [YAML](http://www.yaml.de/)
1. [Less Framework 4](http://lessframework.com/)

[Columnal][id] has proved to be the best framework. It's ease of use is remarkable. It also supports debugging. For beginners, who don't know much about CSS, this framework is useful.
