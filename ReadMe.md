## <title>

The title tag shows the article title followed by a '-' and site title, for example, 'How to revert Git history - Random Thoughts'. 

Sites like [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/) show first the site title and then article title. There is a problem in this approach.  When you open too many tabs, browser delimits tab's title from the end so only the beginning portion of the `<title>` stays visible. Now if the user has opened several tabs from your blog, all will show "Random Thoughts" title. User will have to click on each tab to see what each is about. But if you put the article title before the site title, article title will stay visible, even if tabs width have been narrowed down. User will have less difficultly in identifying the tab from your site he is after. 

Putting site title before the article title increases your site title visibility. But this can be achieved by putting site title on every page and having a distinct fav icon.
